# Kanna Meso Guide

Your major priority prior to 200 is to make everything EPIC on your gear and get 6-9% int on equipment and 6-9%matk on emblem, secondary fan and primary fan (remember Haku can equip a fan as well as you)

Upon reaching 200 don't worry about meso gear, you want to hit 220 asap so damage is priority one. 
VJ range: 2m
ChuChu range: 3m
Lach range: 3-6m
Arcana range: 6.3m+

Upon reaching 220 get 100% total meso on your accessories, 10-20% meso on your inner ability. Then get 60% drop ASAP as it will increase your meso bag drop rate.
Rates (Based off TheRealFarm)

FES2 - 50-60m per hour on 0% meso -2shotting
Raging Erdas 60-80m per hour on 0% meso -2shotting
Slurpee Depths 100m per hour on 0% meso -2shotting

DWT Upper Stem is amazing for 220-230 if you lack the damage for lach. Use a wealth pot with 40% drop for 100% bag drop rate; required range: 2.3m and maxed Shinigami Haunting (level 60 in your V matrix) for one shotting. Domain should one shot with 3m range and Kishen will 2 shot with that same range.
-Rates for DWT:US = 400m/hour with wealth pot and 115% meso; a little more with 120%.
For Lach you want 12 star everything and possibly 15 star Fan; Then prioritize meso gear 100%, and drop 60% at least. To one shot mobs you will need max nodes in Shinigami haunting and around 13-14k stat. 
Good maps:

CFES1 - 380-400m per hour with 3m range clean. 
Outlaw 3 - 350m per hour with 3m range clean. [500m per hour with 5.2m range. Domain, Kishin, Exorcist, Tengu and Boss 1 shot]
Occupied Dance Floor 1 - 350m per hour with 3m range clean. [480m per hour with 5.2m range. Domain, Kishin, Exorcist, Tengu and Boss 1 shot]
REV3 - 350m per hour with 3m range clean.

Once your domain one hits and kishen 2 shots your rates will increase. Above rates are based on 115% meso, 60% drop, WEALTH POT, 2shot domain, 3 shot kishen, 1 shot shinigami.

## Arcana:
DCUP2 - 500m-550m per hour with wealth pot. 6.3m range buffed, maxed tengu strike, lvl 17 Domain, maxed Demon Boss. @level 233
   -note: You will not be one shotting with Kishin, Boss or Domain until you reach the level of the mobs due to damage reduction. Once your boss and domain 1shot your rates will improve. Kishin one shots at around 9-10m range probably.
DCUP1 - 550m per hour with wealth pot.

## THEREALFARM

Method to making kanna, major notes:

1. Make a Kanna during a Ring event so you can get x4 pottable rings
2. Make a Kanna during a Terra Burning event [for Cra, but not necessary as guild can carry you]
3. Gollux is now dead, so use CHT Pendant and Dominator Pendant
4. It's best to get your Commerci accessories asap, although not required (Sweetwater Monocle and Tattoo, Earring is optional)
5. Get your alchemy to level 10 ASAP, WEALTH POTS will be your best friend in this farming endeavour. Juniper seed oils x10, advanced crystals and philosopher stones will be used to create these pots.
6. KEEP your pensalir gear you loot, you MUST extract it via alchemy in order to get philosopher stones and advanced crystals for WEALTH POTS. Also you can NPC the philosopher stones for 300k a pop if you need extra meso.
7. Get 3 Pets and get all the movement expansion skills for them. This will cost around 30-35k nx; well worth it in the long run.

NODES:
1. Optional trio: KISHIN, SHINIGAMI HAUNTING, BOSS
2. Tengu Strike, Exorcist charm, whatever
-remember that every level you get 1 point to enhance a V MATRIX skill box, abuse this to level up your skills early.

Average Costs to get started:
3b. Abuse Ursus and Maple tour. In the mean time work on your main and legion.
